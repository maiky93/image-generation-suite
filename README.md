# Image Generation Suite

A fully standalone SillyTavern extension that adds automated image generation to your chats. The extension monitors conversations, injects prompts to make the LLM produce image descriptions, detects those descriptions, and sends them to ComfyUI or A1111/Forge for generation — all automatically.

Everything is organized through a **profile system** so you can save, swap, and share complete configurations for different characters, art styles, or workflows.

## Installation

### Method 1: SillyTavern Extension Installer (Recommended)

1. Open SillyTavern and click the **Extensions** button (puzzle piece icon) in the top bar.
2. Click **Install Extension**.
3. Paste the GitHub repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/maiky93/image-generation-suite
   ```
4. Click **Save** and reload the page when prompted.
5. Find **Image Generation Suite** in the extensions list → expand it.
6. Check **Enable Extension** and click **Open Settings** to configure.

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Clone or download this repository into your SillyTavern extensions directory:
   ```
   SillyTavern/data/default-user/extensions/third_party/image-generation-suite
   ```
2. Restart SillyTavern.
3. Open **Extensions** in the top bar → find **Image Generation Suite** → expand it.
4. Check **Enable Extension** and click **Open Settings** to configure.

### Requirements

- SillyTavern (latest recommended)
- A local **ComfyUI** or **A1111 / Forge** instance running with API access enabled
- For A1111: launch with `--api` flag
- For ComfyUI: default setup works out of the box

---

## Quick Start

1. **Enable the extension** in the drawer panel.
2. **Open Settings** → go to the **Connection** tab.
3. Select your server type (ComfyUI or A1111), enter the URL, and click the connect button.
4. Select your model, sampler, and desired resolution.
5. Go to the **Prompt Injection** tab → enable prompt injection. The default template works out of the box.
6. Start chatting — the extension will inject an image generation prompt every N messages (default: 1) and automatically generate images from the LLM's response.

---

## The Suite Hub

The **Suite Hub** is a floating, draggable window that provides quick access to the most commonly adjusted settings without opening the full settings modal.

- **Drag** it anywhere on screen.
- **Dock** it to the left or right edge of the viewport — it collapses into a slim sidebar tab and expands on hover.
- **Close** it with the X button; toggle visibility with the `/suitehub` slash command or the Suite Hub Settings toggle.

### Controls Tab

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Character** | Quick-select which character's appearance prompt is used. |
| **Prompt Addition** | Extra positive prompt text appended to every generation. |
| **Negative Addition** | Extra negative prompt text appended to every generation. |
| **Style** | Quick-select art style from your active style profile (with preview thumbnails). |

### Macros Tab

Displays all custom macros you've defined in the Prompt Injection settings. Adjust values in real-time:
- **List macros** → dropdown selector (shows label, uses substitution text)
- **Bool macros** → on/off toggle
- **Int/Float macros** → number input with min/max/step constraints

---

## Settings Tabs

Click **Open Settings** to access the full settings modal. Each tab is described below.

### Suite Hub Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Show Suite Hub Window** | Toggle the floating hub window on/off. |
| **Show Style Previews** | Show style preview images in the hub's style dropdown. |

---

### Prompt Injection

Controls how and when the extension asks the LLM to produce image descriptions.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enable Prompt Injection** | Master toggle. When on, the prompt template is injected into the conversation. |
| **Injection Frequency** | Generate an image every N messages (e.g., 3 = every 3rd message). |
| **Prompt Template** | The full injection prompt sent to the LLM. Use `{macroId}` to insert custom macro values. |
| **Position & Depth** | Where in the conversation history the injection is placed (System/User/Assistant, with depth control). |
| **Character Defining Prompt** | Appended when a character is selected. Use `{character}` and `{outfits}` placeholders. |

Below the injection settings is the **Custom Macros** editor — see [Custom Macros](#custom-macros) for details.

---

### Detection Settings

Controls how image prompts are extracted from LLM output.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Insert Type** | How the generated image is inserted: `New Message` (separate message) or `In Message` (embedded in the assistant's message). |
| **Regex Pattern** | The regex used to detect image tags. Default: `/\<pic="(.*?)"\s*\/?\s*\>/g` — captures content inside `<pic="...">` tags. |
| **Hide from LLM** | When enabled, generated image messages are excluded from the LLM's context window. |

---

### Connection

Configure your image generation backend.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Server Type** | `ComfyUI` or `A1111 / Forge`. |
| **URL** | ComfyUI default: `http://127.0.0.1:8188` · A1111 default: `http://localhost:7860` |
| **Auth** | A1111 only — optional `user:password` for API authentication. |
| **Model / VAE / Sampler / Scheduler** | Populated from the server after connecting. |
| **Steps / CFG Scale / Width / Height** | Standard generation parameters. |
| **Denoising Strength** | For img2img workflows. |
| **Clip Skip** | CLIP skip layers (1–12). |
| **Seed** | Use -1 for random. |

#### ComfyUI Workflow Management (W.I.P.)

When using ComfyUI, you get full workflow CRUD (I highly recommend using the built in ST sd extension workflow editor to make edits):
- **Edit** — Open a full-screen JSON editor for the selected workflow.
- **New** — Create a new empty workflow and open the editor.
- **Rename** — Rename the selected workflow file.
- **Delete** — Remove the selected workflow.

See [ComfyUI Workflow Placeholders](#comfyui-workflow-placeholders) for the template variables you can use in workflows.

### Prompt Construction

Controls how the final Stable Diffusion prompt is assembled from all the pieces.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Prompt Prefix** | Always prepended (e.g., `best quality, absurdres, aesthetic`). |
| **Negative Prefix** | Always prepended to negative (e.g., `lowres, bad anatomy, ...`). |
| **Prompt Suffix** | Always appended after everything else. |
| **Negative Suffix** | Always appended to negative. |
| **Positive Template** | Defines the assembly order. Default: `{prefix}, {prompt}, {promptExtra}, {style}, {loras}, {suffix}` |
| **Negative Template** | Default: `{negativePrefix}, {negative}, {negativeExtra}, {negativeSuffix}` |

---

### Styles

Named art style definitions organized into **style profiles**. Each profile can contain multiple styles.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Style Profiles** | Group styles together (e.g., "Anime Styles", "Realistic Styles"). Switch between groups per main profile. |
| **Style Name** | Display name shown in the hub dropdown. |
| **Style Content** | The actual prompt text inserted as `{style}` in the positive template. |
| **Preview Image** | Optional base64 preview shown in the hub's style dropdown. |
| **Import/Export** | Share style profiles as JSON files. |

---

### Characters (W.I.P)

Define character appearances for consistent image generation. Organized into **character profiles**.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Character Profiles** | Group characters (e.g., "Fantasy RP Characters", "Sci-Fi Characters"). Different main profiles can reference different character sets. |
| **Character Name** | Display name shown in the hub dropdown. |
| **Character Prompt** | The appearance description injected via the `{character}` placeholder. |
| **Outfits** | Named outfit descriptions. All outfits are listed via the `{outfits}` placeholder so the LLM can pick one contextually. |

---

### LoRAs (W.I.P)

Trigger-based LoRA entries that activate when keywords appear in recent chat messages.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **LoRA Profiles** | Group LoRA sets by use case (e.g., "Anime LoRAs", "Realism LoRAs"). |
| **Description** | What this LoRA represents — used for AI agent classification. |
| **Prompt / Content** | The LoRA tag and associated prompt keywords (e.g., `<lora:cyber_arm:1.0>, cybernetic details`). |
| **Trigger Words** | Keywords that activate this entry when found in recent messages. |
| **Case Sensitive** | Whether trigger matching is case-sensitive. |
| **Enabled** | Toggle individual entries on/off. |

---

## Profile System

The extension uses a **nested profile architecture**:

```
Main Profile (e.g., "My Fantasy Setup")
├── Connection settings (server, model, resolution, etc.)
├── Prompt injection settings (template, frequency, position)
├── Prompt construction settings (templates, prefix/suffix)
├── Detection settings (regex, insert type)
├── Custom macros
├── Hub extras (prompt addition, negative addition)
├── Active Style Profile → points to a Style Profile
├── Active Character Profile → points to a Character Profile
└── Active LoRA Profile → points to a LoRA Profile

Style Profiles (global, shared across main profiles)
├── "Anime Styles" → [Style 1, Style 2, ...]
└── "Realistic Styles" → [Style 1, Style 2, ...]

Character Profiles (global, shared)
├── "Fantasy Characters" → [Character 1, Character 2, ...]
└── "Sci-Fi Characters" → [Character 1, Character 2, ...]

LoRA Profiles (global, shared)
├── "Anime LoRAs" → [Entry 1, Entry 2, ...]
└── "Realism LoRAs" → [Entry 1, Entry 2, ...]
```

**Key concept**: Style, Character, and LoRA profiles are **global collections**. Each main profile simply holds a *reference* to which one it uses. This means:
- You can share the same style profile across multiple main profiles.
- Switching main profiles can switch all three sub-profiles at once.
- You can export/import sub-profiles independently.

### Profile Actions

Available on the main profile bar and each sub-profile bar:

| Action | Icon | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **Add** | ➕ | Create a new profile |
| **Duplicate** | 📋 | Clone the current profile |
| **Rename** | ✏️ | Rename the current profile |
| **Delete** | 🗑️ | Delete (cannot delete last profile) |
| **Export** | 📤 | Download as JSON file |
| **Import** | 📥 | Upload a JSON file |

---

## Custom Macros

Custom macros let you define dynamic `{macroId}` placeholders in your prompt injection template that can be adjusted in real-time from the Suite Hub window.

### Macro Types

| Type | Hub Control | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| **List** | Dropdown selector | Predefined options. Each option has a **label** (shown in dropdown) and **text** (substituted). E.g., perspectives, moods, camera angles. |
| **Bool** | On/Off toggle | When ON, inserts the defined text. When OFF, inserts nothing. E.g., "include background description". |
| **Int** | Number input | Integer value with min/max/step constraints. E.g., "number of characters in scene". |
| **Float** | Number input | Decimal value with min/max/step constraints. E.g., "detail level 0.0–1.0". |

### Example

Define a macro with ID `perspective`:
- **Type**: List
- **Options**: 
  - Label: `First person` → Text: `generate as if the image is from the first-person perspective of {{user}}`
  - Label: `Third person` → Text: `generate as if the image is from a third-person perspective`
  - Label: `Birds eye` → Text: `generate as if the image is from a bird's-eye view looking down`

Then use it in your prompt template:
```
When generating an image prompt, {perspective}. Format it as <pic="your prompt here">.
```

The selected option's text will be substituted for `{perspective}` at injection time.

### Reserved IDs

The following macro IDs are reserved and cannot be used for custom macros:
`prefix`, `prompt`, `style`, `styles`, `suffix`, `loras`, `promptExtra`, `negativeExtra`, `negativePrefix`, `negative`, `negativeSuffix`, `character`, `outfits`

---

## ComfyUI Workflow Placeholders

When using ComfyUI, you can use these placeholders in your workflow JSON. They are replaced with the actual values at generation time:

| Placeholder | Replaced With |
|-------------|--------------|
| `"%prompt%"` | Final positive prompt (JSON-escaped) |
| `"%negative_prompt%"` | Final negative prompt (JSON-escaped) |
| `"%model%"` | Selected model name |
| `"%vae%"` | Selected VAE name |
| `"%sampler%"` | Selected sampler name |
| `"%scheduler%"` | Selected scheduler name |
| `"%steps%"` | Steps count |
| `"%scale%"` | CFG Scale value |
| `"%width%"` | Image width |
| `"%height%"` | Image height |
| `"%denoise%"` | Denoising strength |
| `"%clip_skip%"` | Clip skip value |
| `"%seed%"` | Seed value (-1 = random) |

> **Note**: Placeholders must include the surrounding quotes in the workflow JSON, e.g., `"%prompt%"` not `%prompt%`, because the replacement includes JSON escaping.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

**Q: Images aren't generating.**
- Make sure the extension is enabled (checkbox in the drawer).
- Make sure prompt injection is enabled in the Prompt Injection tab.
- Check the Connection tab — click the connect button and verify you see a green status dot.
- Check the browser console (F12) for `[IGS]` prefixed error messages.

**Q: The LLM isn't producing image tags.**
- Check your prompt template in the Prompt Injection tab. Make sure it instructs the LLM to use the correct tag format (default: `<pic="...">`).
- Make sure the injection frequency isn't set too high.
- Check the position/depth settings — try `System (deep)` at depth 0.

**Q: My LoRAs aren't being applied.**
- Make sure the LoRA entries are enabled (checkbox in the editor).
- Check that trigger words match text in recent messages (case-sensitivity setting matters).
- Verify the LoRA prompt field contains the actual `<lora:name:weight>` tag.

**Q: I switched profiles but my characters/styles are gone.**
- Each main profile references specific sub-profiles. Check which style/character/LoRA profile is selected in the respective tabs.

**Q: How do I use this with ComfyUI?**
- Set server type to ComfyUI, enter your ComfyUI URL, and connect.
- Select or create a workflow in the Connection tab.
- Use the workflow placeholders (see table above) in your workflow JSON nodes.

**Q: The Suite Hub is missing from screen.**
- Type `/suitehub` in the chat to toggle it.
- Or go to Suite Hub Settings → check "Show Suite Hub Window".
